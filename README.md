### Hello!
I am a Compliance & Security Manager with a strong background in financial reporting, applications management, policy & procedure development, and database administration. After many years of wrangling CSVs out of various systems to create budget models and utilization dashboards in Excel, I made a serious pivot into data analytics. I completed the UCI Data Analytics Boot Camp in August 2020 and now I'm working to polish this workspace and present some projects.
